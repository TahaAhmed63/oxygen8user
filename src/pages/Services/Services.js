                          1:1 appointments provide a highly personalised
                          approach to developing resilience and enhancing your
                          relationship with stress.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          During these appointments, we explore your unique
                          nervous system and identify strategies that can
                          improve your stress management based on your specific
                          circumstances. By tailoring a comprehensive plan that
                          fits into your weekly routine, we address both
                          immediate stress relief techniques and long-term
                          changes that lead to substantial benefits over time.
                          In addition to utilising various helpful Conscious
                          Nervous System Feedback (CNSF) resources to regulate
                          your nervous system, we focus on optimising your
                          physiology. Over time, you will feel this resilience
                          extend to every aspect of your life.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          To maximise the impact of our sessions, we structure
                          them into three parts. We begin with an initial
                          consultation, where we discuss your goals, lifestyle
                          and emotional wellbeing, before learning some
                          quick-fire downregulating techniques. Following this,
                          you receive a tailored plan to assimilate into your
                          day-to-day life. You have access to email support,
                          allowing you to reach out with any questions or
                          concerns between appointments. At our second
                          appointment, we evaluate your progress and make any
                          necessary adjustments to further enhance your ability
                          to cope with stress. As progress will be likely we can
                          alter plans as required further appointments as you
                          progress.

                          Breathwork is a powerful practice that harnesses the
                          innate connection between our breath and our autonomic
                          nervous system. Through intentional and conscious
                          control of the breath, the techniques offer a pathway
                          to deep relaxation, stress reduction, anxiety
                          management and increased self-awareness. By exploring
                          various breathing patterns, rhythms, and forms,
                          breathwork unlocks the potential to enhance physical
                          and mental wellbeing, as well as process emotional
                          states. Incorporating breathwork into your daily
                          routine has been shown to offer numerous health
                          benefits in studies by renowned neuroscientist Dr.
                          Andrew Huberman at Stanford University.
